## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified visual representation or blueprint of a user interface (UI).
It focuses on layout, content placement, and functionality, rather than design elements like colors, images, or fonts.

Wireframes help teams plan and structure the layout of a digital product early in the development process.
